## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I want to verify some of my ideas about how to make smart home easier for deep customization.

## About name

- Embedded is I want to achieve deep customization of my smart home through customized hardware.

- MSH is my smart home first letters abbreviation with none of special meaning.

Although I think it's not easy to search for this name, but I didn't expect any interesting name.

## About the Language

I will supplement the English documents in the future, but it will be slower.
